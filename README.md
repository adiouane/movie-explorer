# Movie Explorer: A React 18 Application with Optimized Data Handling

## Introduction

Movie Explorer is a React 18 application built with TypeScript, TanStack Query V5, Axios, and optionally Next.js (for server-side rendering and routing). The app efficiently handles data fetching, caching, pagination, modal dialogs, and provides search functionality with debounce, all for an optimized user experience.

## Features

### Movies List Page
- Fetches and displays popular movies from the TMDb API.
- Implements scroll-down pagination for seamless loading.
- Uses caching to avoid unnecessary network requests.

### Movie Details Modal
- Displays selected movie details in a modal.
- Shows a loading state while fetching details.
- Leverages cached data to avoid re-fetching on modal close.

### Search Functionality
- Search bar for movie titles with debounce for optimized API calls.
- Displays search results within the movie list.
